# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on predicting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using various classification techniques. Our primary goal was to develop a robust model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions labeled as Class.
- **Objective**: To build a classification model that accurately predicts the `Class` (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) of a transaction.
- **Best Model**: Our best-performing model is the XGBoost Classifier, which achieved a precision of 0.97 and an accuracy of 1.00.

## Models Employed

We employed several classification models to achieve the best performance, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost Classifier (best model)

## Results

- **Precision**: 0.97
- **Accuracy**: 1.00

These results were achieved using the XGBoost Classifier, which outperformed all other models in terms of precision and accuracy.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features, and used PCA to handle multicollinearity.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of various classification techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Our best model, the XGBoost Classifier, achieved exceptional performance with a precision of 0.97 and accuracy of 1.00.
